# The worst game ever
made to relieve pressure of my life. My parents are going to pension soon and yet, my revenue sources aren't viable enough to make ends meet. I still rely on parents revenue to this day that one day will suddenly end before Odysee advertisement could come viable just like YouTube is. My YouTube channel still not monetized yet, and that requirement is severely extreme!

My mom is concerned so much, she kept asking `when sell game?`! like you wish I would paywall a video game. I've sworn, that the purpose of Perkedel Technologies is to make softwares that are $0, Open Source, and Full version (no crippleware or any expansion paywalled)! She still argued back that I must not to keep on my idealism because this is Earth, realistically I must have job somehow to have atleast medium speed revenue. I say, one day even Oxygen becomes paywalled due to polution somehow despite electric vehicles. Now what? My YouTube Channel is not monetizable yet, Odysee's reward is going to be unviable, the Odysee ad still coming soon, my stonk I have is slow speed, I don't have money, I am broke! I am still trying my best to not losing mind like [Mr. Parted Magic](https://partedmagic.com/ ) who after 2013 it becomes paywalled so we forcedly has to immigrate to [SystemRescueCD](https://www.system-rescue.org/ ), OR OR OR [Faker.js](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70597019/what-happened-with-faker-js ) & Color.js thingy!.

I hate when video game paywalled that's why I have been despised everyone & sparsdated games. But thanks to Gabe Newell, Steam is actually f88888 comfortable, even way more than sparsdating. Although, my soul so sparsdat things never fades because there is alot to consider & see as multiple platform and its exclusive content grows. You must sell your soul for each of those platform just to recoup films and shows you missed & new. Hence sparsdat will make come back.

Wait, there's still way. I remember! How about I put this annoying billboard banner? Let's try again. I didn't say Ad free okay. I just say $0, Open Source, and Full version! that's it. Yeah, the software is Gratis, well full with annoying ads. Even just having non-intrusive banner just one time is considered annoying, I know. But please understand. I am not lucky person. I am one of the most unluckiest. More, as YouTube demonetizes based on political agendas and views. So yeah I need coins. Can you please throw at least one in this [can](https://cointr.ee/joelwindows7)? thancc. No no, not only crypto, there's also centralized donate too! 

Please, help me, don't ignore me! Before the light goes green, just one coin, I need to live. My parents are going to pension soon. look at their age, My dad has already set beyond 50s currently. that's threatening! Why is everybody gas immediately!? C'mon! you didn't know that 3D viral portrait mobile games might have some slavery in it during its development? Would you unrealizingly fund those slave master just by letting ad appears? Please! ah. man. it's hard you know. Now I understand how it feels to be street beggar. Look, I just knock your car side window okay, not punching it. Just open window & toss me one of coins, that easy, not any of the science at all. And of course, I don't do traps like missing leg, or whatever limb, I am full (except down bellow, about 40 degress to the left with little arching left, and oral chaos syndrome, my teeth messed up)! honest!

Okay why worst game ever? It's not 3D. not like those viral mobile games people post on TikTok with funny cursed sounds. all 2D, all drawn with Inkscape not Blender. Sounds are not premium, full of junks! they're basically [ChipTone](https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone ) generated. and only 1 action used, assigned with multiple action keys that were supposedly dedicated to each different actions, hence it's all [Balan's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS1v01-atok ) level of abomination, my apology (except this time, the menu does not use Balan's idiot action set. A & B are different under Godot's built-in UI action sets).

Yeah, feel free to cancel me on Twitter, because I expect that already. I just need money, my mom keeps bothered me with that. I still waiting for Godot 4 release. We're still here on Godot 3.4.x, waiting.
